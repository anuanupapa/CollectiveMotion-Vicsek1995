* Rule
  At each time step a given particle driven with a
  constant absolute velocity assumes the average direction
  of motion of the particles in its neighborhood of radius r
  with some random perturbation added.
  -*Kinetic Phase Transition from "No transport" to "Finite Net Transport" through spontaneous symmetry breaking of rotational symmetry.*
* params 
  noise, density of particles, size of lattice
* Relation to Ferromagnetism
  Spins alligning is equivalent to particles with alligned velocity showing
  collective motion.
  Temperature is equivalent to the perturbation/noise.
